;What are the Mult settings?
;----------------
;The mult settings will allow you to set how much semi-permanant damage you will take for each actor value
;For instance: Say you take a hit with 10 damage. At 0.1 mult for health, your health will permanantly be reduced by (10*0.10)
;----------------

;What are Limit settings?
;-------------------------
;The limit settings allow you to choose how low your actor value can go before Ow will stop reducing total av.
;For instance: At a health limit of 0.5, Ow will only reduce total health by 50%.
;-------------------------

;Values 0.0-1.0 are valid settings. Any other numbers will cause the setting to return to default
